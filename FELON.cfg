// A config that re-enables several parts in Near Future until such a time where replacement parts are available, at which point this mod will be abandoned. I condemn Elon Musk, his actions and his ideals in the strongest of possible terms, but seeing as these pods and especially methalox engines are part of many tech trees and are parts players have come to love I wish to give players the option. This config will be abandoned as soon as replacement parts are completely available, or upon request by Nertea, though he has expressed that he is fine with others re-enabling the parts and telling others how to as long as it isn't in his thread.

	@description = A 2 kerbal capsule with a clever design that has the ability to support use of Chickadee engines - for abort procedures and propulsive landings. This part was removed as it is inspired by technology inextricably associated with Elon Musk, who is a prominent neo-Nazi.

	@description = The ultimate orbital drop-pod - capable of bringing 3 kerbals to a soft landing on any planet with its included Chickadee engines! Chickadee engines not included. RCS is, however. This part was removed as it is inspired by technology inextricably associated with Elon Musk, who is a prominent neo-Nazi.

	@description = A dual-purpose monopropellant engine intended as a landing and abort system for the Nereid and Tethys. You can use them elsewhere, and you'll get great thrust and gimbal, but I hope you're not expecting efficiency.
